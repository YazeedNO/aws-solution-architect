# AWS Developer & Architect

## AWS Certified Solutions Architect & Developer Overview

- It is more common to get the Solution Archtitect license first since it covers a broad spectrum of AWS, however if you are experienced in developing with AWS if may be fine.
    - *Solution Architect* - strong knowledge of *all* AWS services in order to pick what's best for the solution at hand.
    - *Developer* - ability to use specific services in depth to achieve an end product. Broad knowledge of as many services is not there but knowledge in the core services to build applications is deeper.
- 2 levels, *Associate* - that means you have the needed knowledge, and some experience; or *Professional* - you are pretty expert
- The certs are some of the most highly regarded in the software industry, which for one thing means they are at least somewhat challenging. They say you need a year of experience and various knowledge prerequisites (see the blueprints in the links I provide).

## Certification Curriculum

1. Decide to do either Solution Architect or Developer (associate) certification, and then focus on that one in the resourecs below. The developer resourecs are more fleshed out below, but the equivalent resources exist for the Solution Architect certification starting at the link below.

	I recommend starting by reviewing the blueprint, then the Learning Path, then decide what training resources you want to consume first. That could be the starter videos and labs, or if you have enough experience, directly to the offiical training and ultimately the exam. 

1. Build an AWS Developer curriculum from the below resources. 

*Example*:
- Sign up for one of the 3 day training classes.
- Get going with a sample app in AWS to get experience with the services the certification requires.
- Pluralsight class - [AWS Developer: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-developer-getting-started/table-of-contents)
- [Take practice tests](https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-developer-associate-2017-practice-tests/)
