Root Account
It is the account created when you first setup your AWS account.
It has complete Admin access.

New Users
New users have NO permission when created.
New users are assigned Access Key ID and Secret Access keys when first created.
These can't be used to login to the console
These are used to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line
These credentials can be viewed only ones when they are created. If lost then they have to be regenerated.

Always setup Multifactor Authentication on the root account
You can create and customize your own password rotation policy
